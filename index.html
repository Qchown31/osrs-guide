<p>Location <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/cOzCs3x.png">http://i.imgur.com/cOzCs3x.png</a> </p>

<p>Equip ghostspeak amulet if you've banked it at some point</p>
<p>Buy 1 saw, 500 bronze nails and 400 steel nails. If steel nails aren't in stock then buy them later</p>

<p>Home tele, Lumby</p>
<p>Talk to the ghost for Restless ghost quest</p>

<p>
  Inv:
  Gp, bronze nails, hammer, saw, noted planks, 1k arrow shafts, 1k bronze arrowheads
  Leave 10 planks in the bank for questing. It doesn't really matter how many you were able to pick up earlier, our goal
  is just to
  get a few construction levels before wintertodt
</p>

<p>Buy a chronicle and 5 teleport cards from Diango</p>
<p>Walk to port sarim</p>
<p>Buy 1000 feathers</p>
<p>Go to rimmington and use your planks, make chairs until level 4 and then bookcases until you run out of planks.</p>
<p>Use phials to un-note planks</p>
<p>Take the boat to Great Kourend</p>
<p>Make your way to Wintertodt</p>
<p>Fletch all 1k bronze arrows while you walk</p>
<p>If you see wolves near wintertodt, you went the wrong way. Shouldn't get hit by anything on the way.</p>

<p>
  Should now have 15 fletching and hopefully 15+ construction as well, this will increase the xp you get in these skills
  from wintertodt.
</p>

<p>Do Wintertodt until 60 Woodcutting, should get this at 89 firemaking if you don't fletch</p>
<p>
  You really shouldn't be in any danger of dying with 10hp, but pay attention anyway, it's a long walk back if you die.
  10HP accounts start taking 1 damage at 56FM even without warm clothing, but if you dug up the clue hunter boots and
  gloves earlier
  then you might as well use them.
</p>

<p>
  Keep opening the crates until you have 200k gp in bank, after that just keep them until later for better rewards.
  Ideally you should keep the crates until you run out of bank space, but if you don't get 12 mage logs from the initial
  crates,
  then you'll be opening them before Desert Treasure.
</p>

<p>
  Fletching the logs in my opinion isn't worth it but if you want to then go ahead. Personally I just fletch one when
  running from
  the roots to the brazier.
</p>

<p>
  If you want, feel free to get 99 firemaking in one go. Make sure to still keep the crates in the bank after 200k gp
  for
  better loot

<p>Do the Feud</p>
<p>HCIM; if you're scared of going to mage bank, unlock the rune shop.</p>

  blackjack
</p>

<p>Blackjack until 50 thieving, you can buy wines from the bar to use as food.</p>


<p>IF you're planning on 3-tick fishing then home tele to lumby and pick up 15 swamp tar now.</p>
<p>
  If you think you're gonna keep messing up and making the tar multiple times, it might be worth your time getting 23
  hunter
  and using kebbit claws with leather vambs instead. 23 hunter should take just less than 1 hour.
</p>

<p>Use the furnace to make molten glass until level 32 crafting</p>

<p>Get 58 fishing with trout and salmon</p>
<p>Bank the fish for cooking xp</p>
<p>You can pretty easily grow cats while doing this fishing grind since you can just feed it the fish you fish.</p>
<p>I recommend raising 10 cats for death runes in total, after that it's up to you if you can be bothered.</p>


<p>Minigame tele to Burthrope games' room</p>
<p>Cook all of your trout, don't cook salmon yet</p>


<p>Minigame tele to Barb assault</p>
<p>Get 50 agility from barb fishing, should be at 74 fishing.</p>
<p>You can feed caviar and roe to kitten, bring a knife to cut the fish</p>
<p>
  I honestly can't recommend any other way to train to 50 agi than fishing, it doesn't take that long and you'll need
  the
  fish levels
  eventually anyway.
</p>


<p>After 50 agility</p>
<p>Minigame tele to Burthrope</p>
<p>Do the rogue's den minigame for full rogue outfit. Guide by Lelador, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5tQewEZPe4</p>

<p>If you didn't get r scim while training mage, go buy a rune sword from champions guild</p>
<p>Make an attack potion for the fight, speeds it up slightly</p>
<p>Use the west torch as your safespot, https://i.imgur.com/kvn6Mf5.png</p>


Go to Edgeville and talk to Oziach to continue Dragon slayer
Go to mage bank and buy 6k nats, all of the cosmics you can get while buying nats and 10 law runes each world up to 300

they're more
expensive.

Do medium clues if you get them from mining, might get a yew bow from reward (Comp bow works too, it's for temple of
ikov)
There are plenty of ways to get your magic up, i just like this since you get mining, smithing and later fletching xp as
well.
Don't smith the bars into anything yet

Do Turael slayer with dorg cbow until 37 Range and 18 slayer

We'll be using Turael until 50 tasks completed, every 10th task should be done with the highest level slayer master you
can use.
Even though we are using Turael, the goal is to get slayer xp so you should always kill monsters with higher hp, for
example
on bat tasks kill giant bats. Vannaka has too many bad tasks so I think this is overall better.

anyway
HCIM; While this quest might seem like a dangerous one without overheads, it's honestly not. Check out the video.

Here's a video of me completing the quest with same combat stats you'd have: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2SYhpwIh8

You can trap the paladins behind each other same way as the captain from the tourist trap quest.
For the spider, there are 2 skeletons on the east wall, stand between them and then mage the big one with earth blast.
Sometimes
the little ones attack you but just run a bit north and then back to the same spot, they'll get stuck.


Upgrade the iban staff
Get 50 attack doing more Turael slayer, remember to get every 10th task from Vannaka
If you get a task from Vannaka that you really can't do without melee protect then go kill sand crabs until 50 attack

Make an amulet of magic
Kill blue dragons with iban's blast for 43 prayer
We don't have the agility level for shortcut yet so don't bother banking the hides, not worth doing twice as many trips.
Add 2400 xp to your current prayer xp and calculate how many bones you need, level 43 requires 50339xp and 1 bone is
288xp with
ectofuntus (2.4k pray xp is from ghosts ahoy quest which will be completed before using the bones)
Regular ironmen can use the wildy altar if you want to, but either way it's only around 85 bones with ecto so do
whichever method.

Keep 1 dragon bone in your bank for the Watchtower quest


Minigame tele to khazard
Buy however many buckets of slime you need for the bones
Equip Ghostspeak amulet
If you didn't prepare the nettle water earlier, do it now

Do Monkey madness, focus the reward on attack and defense
Do Wanted! quest

Get 40 slayer
Reminder once again, every 10th task from Vannaka (or from chaeldar if you're already 70cb)
Prayer flicking is recommended, but Turael tasks are pretty easy so it's not mandatory
Train range to 40 first and then start training Attack

Do Shades of morton quest
IF there's no one else to help you then this quest can be left until later assuming you used the museum lamps on
herblore earlier.
Take the book to the apothecary in Varrock for some free herb xp

Get 25 herblore if you don't have yet
Do Heroes' quest

Do Fremennik trials
Do Throne of miscellania
Do Royal Trouble

Put at least 750k gp to kingdom, set it on 10 herbs and 5 maples
Always keep it on 10 herbs, but you can switch to 5 teaks at some point if you want to. Maples are good for afk
fletching and
birdhouses.
If you want the absolute maximum yield then you have to get your favour back to 100% EVERYDAY rather than just when you
collect,
however it doesn't really make too big of a difference if you don't. Personally I do it every 3 days or so.

Go back to blackjacking for a few hours and put more money to kingdom so that it doesn't drop below 750k


Clean finds at the museum until you've found all 5 of the items you can get for kudos AND the ruby necklace
Do Bone Voyage quest
Set up your first bird houses
Video by Alkan showing you how to start if you've never done them before: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf02JEqkUcA
Birdhouses were nerfed but they're still by far the best method to train most of your hunter xp.

I'm not gonna remind you to do a birdhouse run, do them every 50mins
Don't bother waking up every 50mins to do a run, but while playing you should at least try to be consistent with them.

AFTER your first birdhouse run, RC should be your lowest skill
Do Tears of guthix quest, do the minigame weekly it's very worth it
RC should always be your lowest skill when you do this


Start The Giant Dwarf quest to unlock Keldagrim
Buy 2 inventories of gold ore from the blast furnace shop
Go Edgeville furnace and make plenty of digsite pendants and games necklaces
Make molten glass until 45 crafting, assuming you have the supplies. You'll need 45 for maple birdhouse when you get the
44 hunter.
45 is around 1k buckets of sand and soda ash


Move your house to Pollnivneach so you can do a birdhouse run and quickly get back to blackjacking.
Entering your POH portal in Poll is a diary task
Get 99 thieving :)

In all honesty it's not absolutely necessary to get 99 in one go, however it's recommended just for the gp you get from
it.
99 thieving with the cape also means you never fail to pickpocket master farmers, so if you don't get 99 then you'll
have to
get your bird house seeds from Olivia, or do master farmers without 100% success rate.

It's possible to do ardy knights instead if you prefer those, you'll have to do Ardy medium diary for them though.
Ardy medium requires a mithril grapple, you can get it as a drop from barbarian spirits if you don't want to do smithing
and
fletching at this point. Iban's blast with protect from melee is probably your best bet there.

This guide assumes you have the gp from 99 thieving, however most of it is spent after barrows gloves so you can still
follow this
without 99.

Buy a thieving cape
Thieve master farmers for a few hours to get a decent amount of seeds for farming and bird houses.
Don't forget to wear rogues and the 99cape whenever you do master farmers
Never farm guams, marrentill or tarromins. (unless you're hcim and need marrentills for training prayer, then farm some
later)
Guide by Lelador, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMCM-tOxCJ0




1.4 Various skilling, agility for graceful

Now that we have kingdom AND birdhouses going it's time to go back to fishing

There are a few options on when to stop barb fishing depending on your goals:

If you don't want to fish at all and you're happy with 74 fishing, skip to the next step.

Getting 84 fishing will get you 60 agility which is a decent enough level since the seers course is actually pretty good
one to
train on. 84 fishing also unlocks anglerfish and minnows for PVM

94 fishing is 70 agility and 70 str. Gets you access to Poll course and by the time you get graceful you'll be around 80
agility.
Also means you can get defenders very quickly since you only need to get to 60 attack

97 fishing is 72 agi and str. Stopping here is recommended if you're going to do some PVM but your goal is also maxing,
the last
2m xp will come from karams/minnows/anglers for PVM

99 fishing if you're rushing max.

Pick whichever option seems best for you. If you're gonna do minnows, get Angler's outfit at 81 fishing so you get manta
rays instead of some crap fish like swordfish.

Keep doing bird houses while fishing.


After fishing (or during if you want a small break)

Buy pinapples for supercompost from charter ships
Put 15 pineapples into each of the compost bins at the allotment patches
Don't do Hosidius patch yet, we'll be doing construction soon which requires house in Rimmington so it's not worth
switching
house to Kourend for 1 compost run and then switching back

Mine Volcanic ash for ultra compost, get like 2k so you don't have to constantly come back to mine more
Do a "compost run" meaning that you just get the compost from the bin and put another set of pineapples in them
Store 15 supercompost in leprechaun for a quest, make the rest into ultras
Use volcanic ash on the full bin rather than individual buckets of supercompost

Buy ~200 chocolate from the grand tree food shop, don't buy too much since it's faster later from the RFD chest
Make energy pots, plenty of harralanders from kingdom


Camelot tele
Plant barley seeds at the hops patch northwest of seers, pay the farmer 3 normal compost to look after them

Minigame tele to blast furnace
Do the Giant Dwarf quest
if you need more rubies or emeralds, the gem stall in keldagrim is usually stocked.

These next 2 quests have times where you have to wait for stuff to happen, smith iron dart tips while you wait

Forgettable tale of a drunken dwarf quest
There's an anvil near the bank in keldagrim
Your barley will be ready when you need it, use it on a range to get the barley malt

Garden of tranquility quest

Enlightened journey quest
You need 6 willow branches for the falador diary on top of the 12 needed for the quest so get those as well
While waiting for the willow trees to grow;

Do Eyes of glouphrie and Tower of life
Smith the rest of your iron dart tips, leave 20 bars for quests

Do a farm run of limpwurts, harralanders and more compost
I'm not gonna be mentioning farm runs anymore, just do them whenever.
Always use ultra compost on herbs, for limps i'd just use normal compost because the seeds are so easy to get.


Go to the woodcutting guild
Cut and make 1500 oak planks
There's a deposit box inside the axe shop which is faster to use than the bank
Get 50 construction
lvl 22-33, oak dining table in the dining room
lvl 33-50, oak larder in the kitchen
Move your house to kourend now for farm patch

Do Temple of Ikov quest
Start fletching iron darts while you run around doing quests
If you didn't get a yew bow from medium clues that you got from skilling, you can get a yew long from young implings or
catch
eclectics for mediums.

Do the Regicide quest
Pick up a few whiteberries just north of the elf tracker


Finish Enlightened journey if you didn't already
Unlock Castle wars and Varrock balloons for diaries


Go to the small island at fossil island with the bank, where you dive to seaweed patches
Make 2 lantern lenses before using all of your molten glass

Dive down and blow all of your molten glass into unpowered orbs
The goal here is to pick up the seaweed spores that spawn every now and then
Like this: https://i.imgur.com/ecDT2Az.png
The spores can spawn north of the anchor so make sure you're checking the minimap and not just your item overlay
I was getting around 25 spores/h while doing this, it's not much but it'll get you started.
Plant seaweed after you get your first 2 spores.

Do Hand in the sand quest, get daily sand every day


Do these quests while fletching darts:
Big chompy bird hunt
Rag and bone man (first part, should have all bones in bank already)
Family crest
Start Legend's quest (Get vanilla pod for RFD)
Death plateau
Troll Stronghold


I'll assume you have fletched all of the darts now.

Go back to the seaweed patches to pick up the random seaweed spores.
Fletch maple shortbows (u) until 55 fletching
Fletch all of your maple logs into maple longbows (u)
You will get a weight warning but you can just ignore that, it makes no difference unless you go to the deep water
Make sure to leave some maple logs for birdhouses


Buy 2300 gold ore from blast furnace ore shop, 2 invs per world
Get goldsmith gauntlets
Get 60 smithing

Go to Edgeville
Craft the gold bars into gold BRACELETS, leave like 30 bars for teleport jewellery if you need to make more
Reminder to buy rubies from either keldagrim or kourend castle gem stalls if you run out
The reason we are doing bracelets instead of amulets is the extra 120gp per high alch, which is worth more than 5xp


Get mage arena cape while you're here anyway
Buy another ~6k nats (from mage bank, get some cosmics too)
HCIM; if scared, you should still have enough nats to get 63mage with alching, and then you can boost to get into wizard
guild.

Do agility until full graceful
Alch your gold bracelets and maple bows while doing agility
Loot kingdom and fletch more longbows to alch if you run out. Finish graceful even if you don't have enough alchs.

Should get to around 70 mage by the time you're done with agility for now


Do all of the RFD subquests
Get 70 cooking at the Hosidius mess hall if you didn't get 70 from 3tick fishing
Buy a bunch of chocolate dust from the chest and make energy pots


Do A soul's bane quest
Complete Varrock medium diary
About daily bstaffs, I personally don't bother with them nowadays since you get so much gp anyway. If you want to do
them then
i'd recommend to at least wait until 59rc so you can rc double cosmics

Get crafting supplies for 61 crafting, make molten glass at Edgeville
Burn your giant seaweed into soda ash
Put house into Yanille and fill your buckets with sand, bank at G.E using varrock tele after medium diary
Lazy edit: do sandstone mining instead, it's a lot faster
I don't have exact number on how many sand and ash you need, you can calculate it like so:
(303000-Current xp) / 72.5
Get 61 craft, might as well do it underwater again for some seaweed spores





1.5 Diaries and finishing RFD

Plant some Toadflax seeds, agility potion is needed soon for a quest
If you didn't get 99 thieving for master farmers or don't have toadflax seed for some other reason, you can do a bit of
brimhaven
agility arena and get 2 toadflax from there
Make a mithril grapple

Do these quests for QP and diaries:
Another slice of H.A.M
Icthlarin's little helper
Eagles' peak
Enakhra's lament
Rat catchers
Olaf's quest
Between a rock
Tai bwo wannai trio
Zogre flesh eater
Rum deal & Cabin fever (Req 42 slayer, you should be close to it. Get a task from Mazchna for Mory diary if you don't
have one)
For the 47 prayer req, you can use the ancient mace spec to boost
One small favour
Watchtower quest

Do all easy and medium diaries
Wildy and fremmy mediums require higher slayer, leave those for when you go back to slayer.
You probably don't have a crystal key for fally medium diary yet so leave that for later as well.
For Lumby 50 range req I'd recommend ranging at pest control with bone cbow
If you're not 70cb for intermediate boat then go do slayer now, train attack to 60 then defense until 70cb
May as well stay until you get 250pts for void bottoms, good mage def. Need 55 range eventually anyway for red chins.


Do Slayer until 60 attack
Buy Dragon scim and Dragon battleaxe

Do Eadgar's ruse
Do My arm's big adventure
Do Desert Treasure
Get as much herb xp you can get from banked herbs and then open wintertodt crates for the mage logs if you didn't get
them early.
If you didn't get any mage logs from the crates then your best option would probably be nature implings in puro puro
Could also do more wintertodt, even at 55hp and 90fm you're only taking 3dmg from the regular hits
Training woodcutting is of course also an option

Finish RFD, buy B gloves
Here's a video of me killing the bosses with stats from following this guide, not too difficult:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv1h-4grhks





2. Goals after Barrows gloves



Get 72 mining and do Lunar's diplomacy
By far the best method for this is to fill up the sandstone machine(25k buckets worth), then claim however much sand you
need for
80 crafting, and fill it again. Doing this will get you most of the sand you need for 93 crafting.
Bring 7 waterskins for a 50min trip, drop them as they empty for more inv space.
Only 60 mining is needed for now so you can do this in bits if you want to, but i'd recommend 72 for making friends with
my arm and
to complete fremmy hard diary very early for the shortcut

Do Magic training arena for bones to peaches (diary req) and infinity boots. Should get you 77 magic if you've been
alching maples
Can also get master wand if you want, mage's book i'd say isn't really worth especially if you got tome of fire from WT.

Get 80 crafting
If you don't have enough giant seaweed yet, just get whatever level you can for now.
Make at least 2 glories, put one in your house for the teleports. Make a ring of wealth to use during slayer
This is of course if you've gotten crystal keys or dragonstone drops yet, which you very well might not have.
Next few dragonstones should probably be skills necks for farming contracts

Get a helm of neitiznot
Get a fighter torso from BA
Get a dragon defender
If you didn't fish for str levels then you're gonna have to do some slayer before defenders to get access to warrior's
guild.
Train defense to 60 while getting defenders

Read the rest of the guide so you'll know what's coming


Start slaying. Plenty of garbage tasks early on, but just gotta deal with them.
Should have plenty of ranarrs from master farmers if you don't want to pray flick.


Prioritize slayer points on;
Blocks* > Superior slayer > Slayer ring unlock > Blocks* > Herb sack/Slayer helm > Broads/Garg finisher > Extensions
*Read the block list

vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
How you slay doesn't really make a difference nowadays, farming contracts give you enough herb seeds so just slay how
you want to
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Use Nieve until 100 combat
Nieve Block/Skip list (This is how I slay, you don't have to do the same depending on your preferences)


Block:
Suqah (Block these asap)
Black demon (Trash, skip if no points to block)
Kalphite (Block after superiors and rings, you can kill the low lvls for fast points)
Hellhound (Block after superiors and rings, do them if you don't have 100pts, not worth skipping)

Skip:
Iron dragon
Steel dragon
Scabarites
Brine rats
Turoth (Not terrible but I wouldn't do these, definitely skip before herb sack)
Waterfiends

Some additional notes:
The only task I ever extend is nechryals
I use the expeditious bracelets on all short tasks like ankou, black dragon
The only tasks I use slaughter bracelets are:
lizardman shaman(flick it for kill) before DWH
Abby demons before whip if I don't bother boosting for it
Krakens before trident.





Get 58 slayer and camp for a black mask, do clues for black dhide
Do Slayer until level 70

If you're fletching maples for some afk time, stop making longbows at around 75 fletching and make arrow shafts instead
Need around 700k arrow shafts(11.6k maple logs) if you're going for 99 fletching
The whole process of making broad arrows is roughly 180k xp/h even if you just bankstand, so a lot better than maple
longs
Broad arrows instead of bolts is because arrows are only 5.8gp/xp compared to bolts which are like 20gp/xp


Regular ironman:
Kill green dragons for 70 prayer, use them at wildy altar
Use loot bag and bank hides also, make dhide bodies
Unlock piety


Next few goals:
100% all zeah favours
100 combat via slayer
Get Void range from Pest control

Hunt 2500 red chins (skip this if you've already got 70 range from some other method)
Start MM2, chin to 70 range
Complete Western provinces hard diary
Get 60 construction with this method: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFH6-oJrJ0o

Get elite void
Hunt red chins until ~92 hunter, get +90 range
Fire cape
Quest cape, SOTE quest boss is pretty hard without brews so you can leave that quest for later.
HCIM: Myth's guild green dragons for 70 prayer, use gilded altar



Switch to Duradel, karamja gloves 3 or npc contact for new tasks
Unlock lizardman tasks, msb(i) and rune arrows or rcbow and runite bolts are very decent at 90+ range against shamans
Unblock black demons until 4 zenytes
I just leave the shards in bank until i get a trident, then i go get chaos runes from barrows
Slayer until trident
complete hard diaries at some point during that grind to mix it up a little


Duradel block/skip list (once again, this is just my preference)


Block:
Abyssal demon (after maybe 5 whip drops, keep suqah blocked until then)
Black demon (after zenytes)
Kalphite
Hellhound (unblock temporarily when you wanna do cerb)
Cave Kraken (after trident and tentacle)
Greater demon


Skip:
Suqah (Do 1 task if you need teeth for spirit tree payment)
Spiritual creatures
Trolls
Fire giant
Iron dragon
Steel dragon
Scabarites
Brine rats
Turoth
Kurask (I think they're garbage even if you get a leaf baxe)
Waterfiends

Some additional notes:
The only task I ever extend is nechryals
I use the expeditious bracelets on all short tasks like ankou, black dragon
The only tasks I use slaughter bracelets are:
lizardman shaman(flick it for kill) before DWH
Abby demons before whip if I don't bother boosting for it
Krakens before trident.




3. PVM preparation, Barrows, Zulrah

After trident:
Get 83 or higher herblore, boost with botanical pie to anti venoms
Get 82 construction with teaks, make the mounted myth cape for higher xp/plank
You could go get a dragon axe from dks before this but even with rune axe it's not that much slower
Boost +8 const for the highest tier pool
Get 93 crafting
Do barrows for 120k chaos runes and buy 4 onyxes for the zenytes
If you get lucky with all the good items first then just buy the rest of the runes
fury is kinda useless so i'd just wait until onyx drop from zulrah

Kill Zulrah for the uniques



I'll be ending the guide here, you can pretty much do anything you want now that you have trident, blowpipe, barrows,
zenytes etc.


Hope you enjoyed this guide.
